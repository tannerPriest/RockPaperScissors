# Rock Paper Scissors

### Influence

- When first learning how to code, I came across a youtuber web developer by the name of DevEd. He has a video that shows himself, performing a walkthrough
of the game Rock Paper Scissors. this was my acutal assignment to make a RPS game for my bootcamp, and he helped me so much and helped me get past that learning bump. 

- I must give credit to him for some of the code in this project. I did write this all by myself with no help by going back too watch the video or view his gitHub repo. I did however, 
go and utilize his .pngs which was very astheitcally pleasing and just looks good!

- I did challenge myself by writing this all in React JS. The real challenge was getting the animation at the end. 

- Using React Spring was a huge find and cant wait too find and explore this new framework I came across!

#### Tech used
